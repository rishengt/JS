JavaScript Pass variables by reference or by values?  
it depends, if it is a primitive type(String, int), then it passes it by value;  
if it is a Object type, then it passes it by reference;  
unlike JAVA, You cannot change the value inside the function, but you can change the Object properties inside the function
